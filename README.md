# HuluFix
Firefox extension to fix hardware media controls on Hulu. When clicking the media controls by default, Hulu does not pause the show for more than 5 seconds. This extension allows you to be able to pause and play your show with your media control keys. It also fixes a bug where the UI will not disappear in Hulu.
